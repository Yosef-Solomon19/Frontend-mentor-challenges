## Overview

For this project the challenge was to build the QR code component and to get it looking as close to the design as possible.
For this challenge I'm primarly working on it for the desktop portion. For the most part I'd say it was a 95% success.
The assests like the icon and the QR-code image is already provided for.

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

I first started with looking at the original image and drawing on my notebook a large rectangle to indicate the browser.
Prior to drawing the QR-component I highlighted areas that can be wrapped in a div. Such as the image and the text with the text also being wrapped in another div. Once I've layed out which components are in div's I started off writing the structure with HTML first. I did add the background color as-well and some borders to make sure that I had the structure down. I added some semantic html such as main then section.

The section would center the content and add margin from the top.
Inside the section are two divs, one to contain the image and paragraphs and a nest div to wrap the paragraphs. Most of the elements have class included for styling purposes.

Now that the structure is complete I moved over to the styling. The majority of my time was spent on

### Built with

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
